            </div>
            <p>
              You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that
              we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment Our
              goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination one
              way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for
              you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk
              about their experience.

              <h3>Interfaces and Community Integration</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community
              resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling your
              payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We&apos;ll
              also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that
              sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health
              information exchanges or other information technology vendors are important, we
              will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.

            </div>
            <p>
              The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which
              we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR
              databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and
              information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward.
              While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has
              been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.

            <p>
              We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content,
              charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks
              prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice
              management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our
              team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on implementation and
              training.

            <p>
              Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be
              with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure
              everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a
              handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt&colon; changing clinical microtemplates,
              setting up new automations, modifying practice management settings, and more.
              We are here to help with it all.

            <p>
              All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide
              support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not
              meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments
              back. We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a
              MIPS guarantee&colon; if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for
              everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a
              long, productive partnership for us both.
